Created a Blog site using Python, Jinja Framework and Google App Engine.
  Users can sign up, login and create posts public to other users.

- Implemented my own sign in and login and used sha256 to create an 
  encryption to protect user passwords. Also, gained knowledge about Google 
  App engine and how to use it with Python and deployed my site there.
